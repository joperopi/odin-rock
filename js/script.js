computerChoice declared inside of it with a blank string, but when I made the final function to
actually play the game, it returned the empty string every time. I'm still not quite sure why that
happened but it didn't happen anymore when I removed the variable declaration from inside the

This function gets the choice from the player. I originally made it in a way that converted it to
lowercase and checked to see if the input was valid, and if it wasn't it ran the function again. I
don't know the implications of calling a function inside of itself, seems a little advanced for my
current knowledge level, so I simplified it by considering any invalid inputs as Rock.

so I wrote the code again to reflect that change.

This is the function that runs the game 5 times and keeps track of the score. The assignment page says
it's possible to do this without loops, but after attempting several times in several different ways,
I admitted defeat and decided to dabble into loops. Thanks to a youtube video by Giovanna Proen√ßa and
the solution from fellow Odin Project student Ryan Jones, I was able to create this loop to run the
game. I'm still not quite sure why it wasn't working without the loop, could very well be a silly
mistake I just failed to account for, but for now I think it's better to keep moving along the course
rather than getting stuck and frustrated in this one issue that can be so easily resolved with content
from the next one or two lessons. Better to save up the brain cells for the learning that is yet to
come, and come back to this project when I feel more prepared to tackle it.
